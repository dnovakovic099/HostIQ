# AI-Powered Analysis

HostIQ uses advanced artificial intelligence to analyze your inspection photos and provide detailed, objective assessments.

## How AI Analysis Works

### The Process

1. **Photo Upload**: You submit inspection photos
2. **AI Processing**: Advanced AI analyzes each photo
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Multiple aspects evaluated
4. **Report Generation**: Detailed report created
5. **Results Delivery**: Scores and feedback provided

### Analysis Components

The AI performs four main types of analysis:

## 1. Room Classification

### What It Does
- Identifies the room type
- Assesses photo coverage
- Determines confidence level

### Room Types Detected
- Bedroom
- Bathroom
- Kitchen
- Living Room
- Dining Room
- Hallway
- Closet
- Balcony
- Exterior
- Laundry
- Office
- Other

### Coverage Assessment
- **FULL** (80%+): Complete room view
- **PARTIAL** (40-80%): Most of room visible
- **CLOSEUP** (<40%): Limited view
- **DETAIL**: Very close shot

## 2. Cleanliness & Guest-Readiness
